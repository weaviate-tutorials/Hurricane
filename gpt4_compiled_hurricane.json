        "blog_context": "But if you have a multi-tenancy case, all you need to do is select multi-tenancy for your class (or classes). You can keep using all your favorite features, including super-fast queries, cross-references, and replication. The only change? For every operation, specify the tenant key \u2013 a user-defined property in your schema. That\u2019s all that changes.Weaviate `v1.20` - coming in July 2023 - changes this once and for all: Native multi-tenancy support that scales to millions of tenants with 10s of thousands of active tenants per node. Yet scale is not the only point that makes the new multi-tenancy feature great; we put a lot of emphasis on compliance and a smooth UX. GDPR-compliant deletes with one command are just one of the many features. Let me walk you through what\u2019s coming in the next Weaviate release and show you why I\u2019m incredibly excited about this one. ## The need for multi-tenancy\nWe define multi-tenancy as the need to serve multiple distinct users or user groups from a single application.## No more workarounds: Native multi-tenancy support for the largest of cases\n\n![multi-tenancy](.\/img\/multi-tenancy-dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n![multi-tenancy](.\/img\/multi-tenancy-light.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n\nLet me walk you through the best parts of the native multi-tenancy feature in Weaviate `v1.20` and even some of the plans that we have for upcoming releases. As you will see, Multi-Tenancy is not just an additional feature. It is rethinking from the ground up how your business, with its many customers, scales with Weaviate. ### Ease of use of your favorite Weaviate features\nWeaviate\u2019s new multi-tenancy mode is opt-in.

        "web_context": "multi-tenancy\nWhat is multi-tenancy?\nMulti-tenancy is an architecture in which a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers. Each customer is called a tenant. Tenants can be given the ability to customize some parts of the application, such as the color of the user interface or business rules, but they can't customize the application's code.\nIn a multi-tenant architecture, multiple instances of an application operate in a shared environment. This architecture is able to work because each tenant is integrated physically but is logically separated. This means that a single instance of the software will run on one server and then serve multiple tenants. In this way, a software application in a multi-tenant architecture can share a dedicated instance of configurations, data, user management and other properties.Advantages and disadvantages of multi-tenancy\nThere are a number of advantages and disadvantages that come with becoming a host provider and a tenant with multi-tenancy. Some advantages include the following:\n- It's less expensive compared to other tenant hosting architectures.\n- It offers pay-for-what-you-use and pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pricing models.\n- Tenants that use a provider's software don't have to worry about updates, because they're pushed out by the host provider.\n- Tenants don't have to worry about the hardware their data is being hosted on.\n- Providers only have to monitor and administrate a single system.\n- The architecture is easily scalable.\nSome disadvantages that come with multi-tenancy include the following:\n- Apps delivered by a provider tend to be less flexible than apps in other tenant architectures, such as single-tenancy.Private cloud multi-tenancy. A private cloud shares the same multi-tenancy concepts as a public cloud, but a private cloud is dedicated to a single organization or group, whereas a public cloud serves the interests of many customers or groups.\nSaaS multi-tenancy. This is a variation of public cloud multi-tenancy because software as a service (SaaS) providers are generally classified as cloud providers. A SaaS provider, for example, can run one instance of its application on one instance of a database and provide web access to multiple customers. In such a scenario, each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants. Multi-tenancy can also be implemented in multi-tier systems such as an SAP system.Multi-tenancy is used more often, as most local data centers, SaaS and other cloud services operate on multi-tenancy. In comparison to single-tenancy, multi-tenancy is cheaper, has more efficient resource usage and fewer maintenance costs, as well as the potential for larger computing capacity. With a multi-tenant architecture, the provider only has to make updates once. With a single-tenant architecture, the provider must touch multiple instances of the software in order to make updates.\nA potential customer would likely choose a single-tenant infrastructure over multi-tenancy for the ability to have more control and flexibility in their environment -- typically to address specific requirements such as security or regulatory compliance.\nLearn how data separation strategies in cloud computing can help organizations keep data safe and ensure that business goals are being met.Serverless multi-tenancy. Serverless computing provides a cloud service that uses events to load and run a customer's code and then dismisses that infrastructure when the code is executed. Many applications can share the same function, and the function loads and runs on any available shared hardware infrastructure.\nMulti-tenant vs. single-tenant\nMulti-tenancy can be contrasted with single-tenancy, an architecture in which each customer has its own software instance and may be given access to source code.Multi-tenancy applications can share the same users, displays, rules and database schemas. Users can customize the rules to an extent and the database schemas.\nImportance of multi-tenancy\nMulti-tenancy is an old idea and traces its roots to classical mainframe architectures where many apps and users shared a common computing hardware platform. With the reintroduction and broad adoption of modern hardware-assisted virtualization, the ability to share hardware among multiple software instances -- such as virtual machines (VMs) and their applications -- placed a new emphasis on multi-tenancy capabilities. The technique gained popularity across local data centers and within hosted infrastructures normally associated with colocation and other shared IT services -- all enabling many users to share limited or common hardware infrastructure.More recently, multi-tenancy has seen its most dramatic adoption with cloud computing. Multi-tenant architectures are found in both public cloud and private cloud environments, enabling each tenant's data to be separated from other tenants. For example, in a multi-tenant public cloud, the same servers will be used in a hosted environment to host multiple users. Each user is given a separate and ideally secure logical space within those servers to run applications and store data.\nMulti-tenancy is also important for the scalability of public and private clouds and has helped make multi-tenancy a standard. The multi-tenant architecture can also help provide a better ROI for organizations, as well as accelerate the pace of maintenance and updates for tenants.\nTypes of multi-tenant architectureHardware -- VM and container -- multi-tenancy. Hardware virtualization enables multiple VMs and virtual containers to be created and hosted on a common server with each VM running a separate application or service managed by a different stakeholder, department or customer. Hardware multi-tenancy is widely used in modern data centers and colocation environments and is a fundamental enabler for all cloud computing.\nPublic cloud multi-tenancy. Customers use instances of resources and services to assemble an infrastructure that's appropriate for hosting a business application. But every cloud resource or service shares underlying hardware and network bandwidth. Public clouds can deliver dedicated resources to customers, but this is an exception rather than the rule.- It is, in general, more complex than single-tenancy because of the additional virtualization and management needed to isolate and secure each tenant.\n- Apps need stricter authentication and access controls for security.\n- Tenants have to worry about noisy neighbors, which might slow response time for other tenants sharing the same resources.\n- Downtime might also be an issue, depending on the provider. Collateral impacts such as one server problem affecting many users can also be an undesirable risk.\nMulti-tenancy examples\nThere are numerous examples of multi-tenancy, including the following:Types of multi-tenant architecture\nThere are three main multi-tenancy model types, all with varying levels of complexity and costs. Each model is traditionally discussed in terms of application and database -- the data used by the application -- relationships.\n- Single application, single database. A single, shared database schema is a multi-tenancy model with a multi-tenant database. This is the simplest form out of the three model types and has a relatively low cost for tenants because of the use of shared resources. This form uses a single application and database instance to host multiple simultaneous tenants and store data. Using a single, shared database schema enables easier scaling; however, operational costs can be higher and noisy neighbor effects can potentially affect performance.- Single application, multiple database. This multi-tenant architecture includes the use of a single database with multiple schemas. This tenant system uses a single application instance with individual databases for each tenant. In addition, this architecture is more difficult to scale and has a higher cost and more overhead with each database. It's a valuable architecture when data from different tenants need to be treated differently -- such as if they had to go through different regulations per geographic region. Separate databases also help to reduce potential noisy neighbor effects.\n- Multiple application, multiple database. This type of multi-tenant architecture hosts data in multiple databases. This model is relatively complex in terms of cost, management and maintenance, but the approach is secure and tenants can be separated by a chosen criterion.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of multi-tenancyA single-tenant architecture resembles a one-server-one-application approach that's reminiscent of traditional data centers before the broad adoption of server virtualization. In hosted single-tenant architectures, a tenant will have a singular instance of a SaaS application dedicated to them, unlike multi-tenancy where there are shared services. Because each tenant is in a separate physical environment or infrastructure, they aren't bound in the same way that users of shared infrastructure would be -- meaning single-tenant architectures are much more customizable.SaaS: Single Tenant vs Multi-Tenant - What's the Difference?\n|Contact Us|\n|Free Demo|\n|Chat|\nWhat are the advantages of a multi-tenancy SaaS architecture? How does it differ from single tenant instances? We break down the differences and highlight the benefits of implementing a SaaS solution for data protection in this blog.\nWhat is Multi-Tenancy?\nMulti-tenancy means that a single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers.\nIn the early days of the cloud, organizations were reluctant to adopt cloud strategies. Few organizations considered applying policies, technologies, and controls to protect data across the cloud. The last several years, which has seen the proven effectiveness of cloud deployments in scalability, cost, and security, has changed that however. Now we\u2019re seeing the rapid adoption of cloud platforms by organizations of all shapes and sizes.What is single tenancy?\nSingle tenancy means that there is only one instance of a cloud software solution running on its supporting hardware and infrastructure components. There is no sharing with multiple customers involved in a single-tenancy environment.\nWhat does multi-tenant mean?\nIn a multi-tenant environment, cloud infrastructure is shared among multiple customers or accounts. No single customer has control over how resources are allocated or consumed.\nWhat are the advantages of single-tenant hosting?\nThere are multiple advantages of single-tenant hosting that include:\n- Enhanced security - Running an SaaS solution on dedicated hardware improves security by eliminating potential malware infections and unauthorized data access from other tenants.\n- Improved performance and reliability - Customers in a single-tenant environment have full access to infrastructure resources that can lead to better and more consistent performance.Multi-tenancy architecture also allows Digital Guardian to efficiently service everyone from small customers, whose scale may not warrant dedicated infrastructure, to large enterprises that need access to the cloud\u2019s virtually unlimited compute resources. Software development and maintenance costs are shared, driving down expenditures, resulting in savings that are passed onto you, the customers.\nAdditional Benefits of SaaS\nMulti-tenancy is just one of multiple benefits of SaaS. Download this white paper \u2013 7 Reasons to Move to SaaS Data Protection to learn:\n- The 7 reasons why moving to SaaS data protection enables you to manage risk more effectively\n- How Digital Guardian\u2019s cloud architecture is built with the latest tools and methodologies\n- How we can help offset resource constraints with our Managed Security ProgramDigital Guardian\u2019s Data Protection Platform leverages software as a service, or SaaS, to provide data protection in a package that results in superior security, better economics, and reduced overhead. One of the ways we do this is through multi-tenant architecture.\nIn this post, we'll walk through why that is, as well as the key differences between multi-tenant vs single-tenant architecture.\nSingle Tenant vs Multi-Tenant \u2013 What Does Each Term Mean?\nSingle Tenant \u2013 A single instance of the software and supporting infrastructure serve a single customer. With single tenancy, each customer has his or her own independent multi-tenant database and instance of the software. Essentially, there is no sharing happening with this option.\nPotential benefits of single-tenant include:\n- Security: A single customer and a single server is often contained on secure hardware being used by a limited number of people.- Updates\/Changes: If you\u2019re reliant on integrations with other SaaS products and one updates their system, it may cause issues with those connecting apps.\ndatasheets\nDigital Guardian Software as a Service (SaaS)\nBenefits of SaaS Multi-Tenant Architecture\n- Lower costs through economies of scale: With multi-tenancy, scaling has far fewer infrastructure implications than with a single-tenancy-hosted solution because new users get access to the same basic software.\n- Shared infrastructure leads to lower costs: SaaS allows companies of all sizes to share infrastructure and data center operational costs. There is no need to add applications and more hardware to their environment. Not having to provision or manage any infrastructure or software above and beyond internal resources enables businesses to focus on everyday tasks.Single tenant and multi-tenant are two methods of offering cloud software as a service (SaaS) solutions. The difference is in how the software is accessed by customers. Single tenant provides each customer with a distinct software instance running on infrastructure that is not shared with other users. Multi-tenant uses a shared infrastructure to provide access to the SaaS solution to multiple customers. A common analogy speaks to the difference between living in an apartment versus a single-family dwelling. Everyone in the apartment shares resources like water and electricity. It\u2019s possible that a few tenants can monopolize resources at the expense of the rest. Occupants of a single-family dwelling don\u2019t have to share resources with anyone and have complete discretion over their usage.\nWhat is single tenancy?To learn more about the benefits of SaaS, watch the clip below from our webinar, Benefits of Implementing a SaaS Cybersecurity Solution, which is presented by Andras Cser, VP Principal Analyst at Forrester. You can watch the full webinar here.\n<\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is the difference between single tenant and multi-tenant?- Dependability: With an entire environment dedicated to one client, resources are abundant and available anytime.\n- Customization: Control over the entire environment allows for customization and added functionality, if desired.\nPotential drawbacks of single-tenant:\n- Maintenance: Single-tenant typically means more tasks and regular maintenance to keep things running smoothly and efficiently.\n- Setup\/Management: By comparison, SaaS multi-tenant environments are quick to setup and manage.\n- Cost: Single-tenant typically allows for more resources, but at a premium price given that there is only one customer for the entire environment.\nMulti-Tenant \u2013 Multi-tenant means that a single instance of the software and its supporting infrastructure serves multiple customers. Each customer shares the software application and also shares a single database. Each tenant\u2019s data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.\nPotential benefits of multi-tenant:Multi-tenant architecture, more commonly referred to as multi-tenancy, is a software architecture where multiple instances of an application run on the same physical server. The same server is then responsible for serving multiple tenants simultaneously.\nThis type of build allows companies to allocate a single infrastructure to several end users, rather than individually managing the maintenance and updates of multiple environments.\nThis article will help you understand how multi-tenancy works as well as its advantages and disadvantages and the various types of databases used in them.\nTable of Contents\n- How Multi-Tenancy Works\n- Advantages of Multi-Tenancy\n- Disadvantages of Multi-Tenancy\n- 3 Main Types of Multi-Tenant Databases\n- 3 Multi-Tenant Architecture Examples\n- Choosing Between Multi-Tenant and Single-Tenant Architecture\nHow Multi-Tenancy WorksMulti-tenant architecture works by utilizing virtual machines (VMs). On the same physical server, they\u2019re able to create multiple VMs that all share the same hardware but operate as separate computers in complete independence from one another. This guarantees the user\u2019s security and privacy, especially if the cloud environment is shared with foreign individuals and entities.\nThis is the opposite of single-tenancy, in which the server runs one instance of the operating system and one application. This one application could be something simple like file and print apps, complex like web or application servers, or mission-critical such as a database.\nFeatured Partners: IT Software\nWhat is the Difference Between a Multi-Tenant and Single-Tenant Architecture?\n|Multi-tenancy||Single-tenancy|\n|Cost||Affordable thanks to cost-sharing with other tenants||All operation costs are paid by the single-user entity||Efficiency||Only use the resources you need||There\u2019s wasted potential and poor efficiency if the environment isn\u2019t run to full capacity|\n|Customizability||Shared software environments are designed with a one-size-fits-all approach with minimum customization options||Single tenants can customize the software environment to suit their needs|\nSingle-tenancy is largely seen as the \u201cdeluxe\u201d option, in that a client operates in a solely dedicated environment. In a multi-tenant environment, each customer shares the software application along with a single database, so multiple people from the same company can access the database. Still, even in multi-tenancy, each tenant is isolated from other tenants.\nThe chief advantage of multi-tenant hosting is that it is less expensive. Resource pooling greatly reduces the cost since companies only pay for what they need. And since multi-tenancy is part of a SaaS provider, companies are not paying for on-premises hardware.Improved Security and Privacy\nWhile single-tenant architecture offers more advanced security and privacy capabilities, multi-tenancy is still considerably more secure than relying on other methods of sharing data and software resources among a pool of users.\nThe security and privacy of the data processed on the multi-tenant cloud are guaranteed and maintained by the service provider. Additionally, having everything in the same environment allows for effective threat and intruder detection and prevention, compared to spread-apart resources.\nBackup and Data Restoration\nSome multi-tenancy providers include a built-in data backup and recovery system that allows businesses to manage data reliably. When configuring for regular backup, it\u2019s best to implement an option offered by service providers themselves, as they tend to be more familiar with the best way to handle data on their cloud.\nDisadvantages of Multi-TenancyMulti-tenancy is at the heart of cloud computing. It is designed to help scale up thousands of users both within an enterprise and externally as companies interact and do business. Whether it\u2019s a Salesforce account or an app the company built on AWS for customers, multi-tenancy can scale through public and private cloud and provide true economies of scale.\nImplementing a Multi-Tenant Architecture\nMulti-tenant architecture is an approach to data structuring, usually in a cloud environment, that allows multiple users to access and share the software and hardware resources of the environment. This is done with complete separation between individual customer entities to ensure the privacy and security of their data.How Multi-Tenancy Works\nThe term \u201ctenant\u201d is used to describe the group of users or applications that share access to the same hardware resources. In a multi-tenant architecture, all users share access to the same infrastructure resources that could facilitate collaborative work such as memory, network controller, and access to system resources.\nIt\u2019s used often in cloud computing, enabling service providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to offer a more affordable shared-tenancy option on the public cloud. However, it can also be utilized by software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies or companies with internal software that needs to be distributed to employees in various departments and physical locations.When implemented into a multi-tenant architecture, all of the instances within a VM have to share the same base operating system, applications, and database access. In fact, this is the same model that\u2019s used in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and SaaS offerings.\nSince IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS rely on resource sharing, from hardware to software, they use multi-tenancy in running their environment. This also enables them to create high-scalability offers for customers.\nThat\u2019s how 50 people from the same company can work on Salesforce CRM. Similarly, a SAP system is composed of a database back end and web application servers that host web services in a highly scalable manner. The web services that make up the SaaS app are exposed to different customers via different domain names. Scaling is achieved by starting more services.\nThe following are three examples of a multi-tenancy architecture:\n1. URL-Based SaaSDisadvantages of Multi-Tenancy\nBefore switching to a multi-tenant cloud offering, it\u2019s just as important to be aware of the limitations and drawbacks of using this type of architecture. The following are a handful of multi-tenancy\u2019s most notable disadvantages.\nLacks Customizability\nMulti-tenant architecture is considered an off-the-shelf product, and since businesses will share software and hardware resources with multiple other customers, they\u2019re limited in the changes they can implement.\nThis reduction in control can hinder business operations and a team\u2019s progress online, as certain features may be missing while others are in the way.\nCompeting for Limited Resources3. Multiple Databases, Multiple Schemas\nThe multiple database approach takes the separations of schemas and datasets a step further. Clients can have different divisions of data on completely separate databases, such as segregating for sales, customers, and employees, or dividing by region.\nThe host would have to install the application separately for each client on their database, which adds a layer of complexity to management, maintenance, and scalability to this type of multi-tenancy deployment as well as the costs.\nOn the flip side, this approach to multi-tenancy affords the clients a higher level of data isolation, improving the privacy and security of their data.\n3 Multi-Tenant Architecture Examples\nIn utilizing virtual systems in VMs, a single system would have to handle numerous instances, all running several versions or even different operating systems. Also, each one of those instances has to run its own application along with its associated database.Functions like system monitoring and servicing the deployment become shared among all of the customers, which makes it less expensive as the cost is spread around.\nAdvantages of Multi-Tenancy\nThe multi-tenant model is used by numerous reputable cloud providers because it\u2019s sought after by users and clients in a wide variety of fields. The following are a handful of multi-tenancy\u2019s most notable advantages.\nReduced Costs\nMulti-tenant cloud architecture models tend to be more cost-efficient than their single-tenant counterparts. This is because most service providers follow a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where companies don\u2019t have to pay for the entirety of the cloud environment if they\u2019re not occupying or using it.\nThe cost of a single environment is, instead, shared by all of the tenants. This not only includes the costs of the hardware but also all of the software and maintenance work going into keeping the environment running.\nIt\u2019s Highly ScalableThis approach tends to be slightly more complex for the host due to the number of databases and schemas accessed by clients, along with the restrictions they need to put in place at the database level. However, this is still how many SaaS apps operate as it often allows for more direct interaction with the database, cutting back on lag and wait times.\nAnother benefit to utilizing a multi-tenant approach to SaaS applications is the increase in computing capacity per customer. Also, individual customers won\u2019t have to worry about server and processing power capacities, but simply access the system and pay according to the resources they use.\nSimilarly to other approaches to multi-tenancy, this reduces the customization options for customers. Dedicated upgrades tend to be time-consuming and more complex to implement without negatively affecting the rest of the environment for the remainder of the customers.\n3. Virtualization-Based SaaSIt\u2019s Highly Scalable\nWorking with cloud service providers is highly scalable. Companies don\u2019t need to plan the purchase and onward maintenance of an extension to their environments; they simply request a larger offering.\nThis also goes the other way around. If companies need to scale down operations, they\u2019re not left with unused server space that still needs maintenance. The down-scaling process is just as easy and seamless as upscaling.\nMaintenance-Free\nWith multi-tenancy, companies are buying into a done-for-you product that already includes all of the necessary maintenance work for its software and hardware components, ranging from software updates and patches to ensuring availability, backup, and uptime.\nAll of the labor needed to maintain the environment is included in the contract and shared with other tenants.\nImproved Security and Privacy3. Virtualization-Based SaaS\nVirtualization-based SaaS, also known as containerized SaaS, is the most complex SaaS setup approach.\nThrough virtualization, the SaaS provider would be creating an entirely separate virtual version of all resources needed to run the software service, including the servers, desktop, operating system files, storage, and network access. Those would have to co-exist on the same hardware infrastructure without interacting with or influencing one other.\nWhen it comes to implementing a multi-tenant architecture alongside virtualization, regular interaction between the containers, applications, and databases is essential. This is what makes it incredibly complex to maintain. Such structures tend to require specialized container orchestration tools to manage the communication and influence between individual containers, like Kubernetes and Docker.3 Main Types of Multi-Tenant Databases\nIn a multi-tenant environment, multiple customers share the same application, in the same operating environment, on the same hardware, and with the same storage mechanism and database.\nThis is how Salesforce and every other SaaS operator run. Every tenant is a customer or user who has common access and specific privileges in the software instance.\nThe database, however, is another matter. There are three ways to architect a database in a multi-tenant system.\n1. Shared Database, Shared Schema\nThe simplest and most straightforward application of a multi-tenant architecture involves the sharing of multiple schemas for the same database. A schema refers to the construction of a database, and it\u2019s usually made out of database tables that relate to one another.\nThe tables are used to manage the simultaneous access to the same dataset, like when two people are attempting to manipulate the same table or data entry at the same time.",

In the context of introductions, the term \"multi-tenancy\" could be introduced at the beginning of a document or presentation to establish the subject matter and provide context for the subsequent content. An introduction serves as a guide for the audience, outlining the scope and objectives of the material to follow. It may also include a brief summary or a hook to engage the audience's interest. In technical writing, such as a report on multi-tenancy, the introduction might include a summary of the architecture's benefits and challenges, setting the stage for a deeper exploration of the topic. Whether in a blog post, research paper, or web article, the introduction is a crucial element that frames the reader's understanding and sets expectations for the information presented.\nMulti-tenancy is an architectural concept where a single instance of software serves multiple customers, known as tenants, with each tenant's data isolated and invisible to others. This approach is prevalent in cloud computing, including private and public clouds, and is particularly advantageous for SaaS providers. It allows for cost-effective resource utilization, simplified maintenance, and scalability. However, it can also introduce challenges such as the \"noisy neighbor\" effect, where tenants may compete for shared resources, potentially impacting performance. Weaviate, an open-source search engine powered by machine learning, is set to enhance its multi-tenancy capabilities with its v1.20 release in July 2023. This update aims to support millions of tenants with thousands active per node, emphasizing compliance, user experience, and GDPR-compliant operations. Weaviate's approach to multi-tenancy is designed to be opt-in, maintaining ease of use for existing features while scaling efficiently to accommodate diverse tenant sizes, from small to large, without incurring unnecessary costs during idle periods. This evolution of multi-tenancy in Weaviate reflects a broader trend in cloud services, where the ability to serve a multitude of distinct users or groups from a single application is not just an added feature but a fundamental rethinking of how businesses can scale effectively and securely.\nThe importance of multi-tenancy in software architecture is underscored by its ability to serve multiple customers or tenants from a single application instance, while maintaining each tenant's data in isolation. The original question, \"What is multi-tenancy?\" leads to an exploration of its benefits and distinctions from single-tenancy. Multi-tenancy offers cost-efficiency, as seen in the Weaviate `v1.20` update, which supports millions of tenants with thousands active per node, and ensures compliance with features like GDPR-compliant deletes. It also provides diverse support for tenants of varying sizes, crucial for businesses like ACME Accounting that handle both large and small customers. The shared infrastructure of multi-tenancy leads to lower costs and less maintenance, with providers only needing to update a single system. However, it can also introduce complexities such as the need for stricter access controls and potential performance impacts from \"noisy neighbors.\" Despite these challenges, the scalability and resource efficiency of multi-tenancy make it a standard in cloud computing, offering a better return on investment and faster pace for maintenance and updates.\nMulti-tenancy in Weaviate represents a significant evolution in how businesses can scale their operations and manage data for multiple distinct users or user groups within a single application. Stemming from the original question, \"What is multi-tenancy?\", it's clear that this feature is crucial for companies like the fictional ACME Accounting Group, which requires the ability to serve over a million customers while ensuring data isolation and security. With the introduction of native multi-tenancy support in Weaviate `v1.20`, the platform now enables the creation of lightweight shards, allowing for the isolation of tenant data and the scaling to millions of tenants with tens of thousands of active tenants per node. This massive scalability is complemented by GDPR-compliant deletion processes and an opt-in model that maintains the ease of use of Weaviate's features, such as super-fast queries and cross-references, by simply specifying a tenant key for operations. The anticipation for the release of Weaviate `v1.20` in July 2023 is high, as it promises to eliminate previous workarounds and offer a robust, compliant, and user-friendly multi-tenancy solution that can handle the diverse and dynamic needs of businesses with large customer bases.\nTopic: Advantages of Multi-Tenancy\n\nOriginal Question: What is multi-tenancy?\n\nWeb Contexts: Multi-tenancy is a cloud architecture where multiple clients share the same computing resources, each known as a tenant. This sharing applies to software resources and hosting on servers, allowing multiple instances of an application to operate in a shared environment. Multi-tenancy offers cost-effectiveness, scalability, security, privacy, and efficient resource use. It's maintenance-free for the customer, with the host handling updates and upgrades. However, there are security risks, such as potential data exposure. Popular multi-tenancy applications include Salesforce, WordPress, and Netflix.\n\nBlog Contexts: Weaviate's native multi-tenancy feature allows for easy use of favorite features like super-fast queries and cross-references, with the only change being the specification of the tenant key. It's designed for ease of use, cost-efficiency, and diversity of tenants, accommodating both large and small customers. The upcoming Weaviate release promises GDPR-compliant deletes, speed, easy onboarding and offboarding, and resource boundaries to prevent tenant interference.\n\nParagraph: The concept of multi-tenancy, as explored in response to the question \"What is multi-tenancy?\", refers to a cloud architecture where multiple clients, or tenants, share the same computing resources, such as software and server hosting. This model is akin to an apartment complex where residents share the building's infrastructure but have their own private spaces. The advantages of multi-tenancy include cost savings, as resources are shared and maintained collectively, leading to lower expenses for each tenant. It also offers scalability, allowing businesses to adjust their resource usage as they grow. Security and privacy are maintained through logical separation of tenant data, and the model is generally maintenance-free for customers, with the host managing updates and maintenance. Weaviate's upcoming release further enhances multi-tenancy with features like GDPR-compliant deletes and efficient resource boundaries, ensuring that the activities of one tenant do not adversely affect others. This architecture is particularly beneficial for diverse tenant sizes and is exemplified by applications such as Salesforce and WordPress, which serve a multitude of clients on a single platform.\nTopic: Disadvantages of Multi-Tenancy\n\nOriginal Question: What is multi-tenancy?\n\nWeb Contexts: Multi-tenancy is a common architecture for cloud services where a single instance of software serves multiple customers or tenants. While it offers cost savings and scalability, it also has several disadvantages. These include inflexibility, as customers cannot always dictate where their data is stored, which can be a problem for businesses with strict data residency requirements. Security is another concern; a breach in a multi-tenant environment could potentially compromise the data of multiple customers. Additionally, multi-tenant platforms may lack the power and features of dedicated solutions, with limitations on data storage and support for standard programming languages. The cost of migrating to a multi-tenant platform can also be prohibitive for smaller companies.\n\nBlog Contexts: The blog from Weaviate highlights the evolution of multi-tenancy support and the challenges faced before the introduction of native multi-tenancy support in Weaviate `v1.20`. It discusses the difficulties in scaling and managing a large number of tenants, as well as the need for compliance and smooth user experience. The new release aims to address these issues by providing GDPR-compliant deletes and the ability to handle millions of tenants efficiently.\n\nParagraph: The concept of multi-tenancy, while beneficial for its cost-efficiency and scalability, presents several challenges that can impact businesses negatively. Inflexibility in data residency can clash with strict national privacy laws, making it difficult for companies to comply with regulations. Security risks are amplified in a multi-tenant environment, where a single breach could expose the data of numerous tenants. The limitations in features and data handling capabilities can render multi-tenant platforms less powerful compared to dedicated solutions, and the costs associated with transitioning to such platforms may be daunting for smaller businesses. Despite advancements like Weaviate's native multi-tenancy support, which aims to improve scalability and compliance, the disadvantages of multi-tenancy remain a concern for enterprises requiring robust, secure, and flexible cloud services.\nTopic: Types of Multi-Tenant Architecture\n\nOriginal Question: What is multi-tenancy?\n\nWeb Contexts: Multi-tenancy is a software architecture where multiple instances of an application run on the same physical server, serving multiple tenants simultaneously. This architecture allows companies to allocate a single infrastructure to several end users, optimizing maintenance and updates. There are three main types of multi-tenant databases: shared database with shared schema, where multiple schemas for the same database are shared; URL-based SaaS, where different domain names expose web services to different customers; and multi-tenant SaaS, where customers share the same software and hardware. Multi-tenancy is crucial in cloud computing, enabling providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to offer shared-tenancy options on the public cloud. It is also used in private cloud computing, where different teams within the same organization share infrastructure.\n\nBlog Contexts: Weaviate's approach to multi-tenancy allows users to select multi-tenancy for their classes, maintaining features like fast queries and cross-references while specifying a tenant key for operations. This approach addresses the need for speed, easy onboarding and offboarding, and resource boundaries without affecting other tenants. Weaviate's native multi-tenancy support is designed to scale with businesses and their customers, offering cost-efficiency and the ability to handle tenants of different sizes.\n\nParagraph: Multi-tenancy, a fundamental concept in cloud computing, refers to a software architecture where a single instance of an application serves multiple tenants, or customers, using shared resources such as databases, hardware, and software. This architecture is essential for cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, as it allows them to offer cost-effective, scalable services to a diverse range of clients. The types of multi-tenant architecture include shared database with shared schema, URL-based SaaS, and multi-tenant SaaS, each with its own method of resource sharing and data isolation. Weaviate's implementation of multi-tenancy exemplifies the modern approach to this architecture, focusing on ease of use, scalability, and efficient resource management, ensuring that the needs of both large and small tenants are met without compromising on speed or functionality. This aligns with the original question about multi-tenancy by illustrating how multiple users or applications can securely and efficiently share the same infrastructure, which is a cornerstone of cloud computing's practicality and success.\nThe concept of multi-tenancy versus single-tenancy in cloud computing and SaaS platforms is a critical decision point for businesses and software developers, as it impacts cost, security, scalability, and customization. The original question, \"What is multi-tenancy?\" leads us to explore the differences between these two architectural models. Multi-tenancy refers to a single software instance and infrastructure serving multiple customers or tenants, with each tenant's data isolated but operating within a shared system. This model is akin to residents living in separate apartments within the same building, sharing common facilities but maintaining private spaces. It offers cost savings, efficient resource usage, and easy scalability due to economies of scale, but it can pose greater security risks and complicate cost visibility per customer. Single-tenancy, on the other hand, provides each customer with a dedicated instance of the software and infrastructure, resembling a single-family home with its own amenities and security system. This model offers greater customization, security, and control, but at a higher cost and potential underutilization of resources. A mixed tenancy model attempts to balance these approaches by providing some dedicated and some shared components. Authoritative blog posts from Weaviate highlight the ease of implementing multi-tenancy in their platform, where specifying a tenant key in the schema is the primary change required to maintain efficient operations across numerous tenants. This approach addresses the need for cost-efficiency, diversity of tenant sizes, and resource boundaries without compromising on speed or ease of onboarding and offboarding tenants. Ultimately, the choice between multi-tenancy and single-tenancy depends on the specific needs of a business, including considerations around privacy, security, scalability, and cost.\nTopic: Multi-Tenancy Use Cases\n\nOriginal Question: What is multi-tenancy?\n\nWeb Contexts: Multi-tenancy is an architecture that allows a single instance of software to serve multiple tenants, where tenants are different user groups or customers. It is a common approach in cloud services, enabling efficient resource usage and cost savings. GRNET, for example, uses a project-based approach for resource allocation in a multi-tenancy environment, aiming to enhance data isolation and explore encryption solutions for stronger security. Multi-tenancy is often contrasted with single-tenancy, where each tenant has a dedicated set of resources, allowing for greater customization but at a higher cost and with a larger infrastructural footprint.\n\nBlog Contexts: Weaviate's v1.20 release introduces native multi-tenancy support, simplifying the management of multiple tenants by allowing users to specify a tenant key for operations. This feature is designed to be cost-efficient, handle a diversity of tenant sizes, and ensure ease of use with Weaviate's features. It also emphasizes compliance, such as GDPR-compliant deletes, and aims to provide a smooth user experience with minimal computational load for onboarding or offboarding tenants, as well as maintaining resource boundaries to prevent one tenant's activities from affecting another.\n\nParagraph: Multi-tenancy is a software architecture that enables a single application to serve multiple distinct user groups or customers, each considered a tenant. This approach is particularly beneficial in cloud environments, as it optimizes resource usage and reduces costs. For instance, GRNET's adoption of multi-tenancy allows for project-based resource allocation while seeking to enhance data security through encryption. Weaviate's v1.20 release further simplifies multi-tenancy by introducing native support that scales efficiently, maintains resource boundaries, and ensures compliance with regulations like GDPR. This allows for diverse tenant sizes and demands, from small to large, and facilitates easy tenant management, including onboarding and offboarding, without affecting the performance or service delivery to other tenants. Multi-tenancy, therefore, offers a future-proof platform that balances performance, cost, and maintenance, making it a preferred choice for many organizations over single-tenancy, which, while offering greater customization, comes with higher costs and a larger infrastructural footprint.\nThe concept of multi-tenancy refers to a software architecture where a single instance of an application serves multiple customers or tenants. The original question, \"What is multi-tenancy?\" highlights the need to understand how this approach allows for efficient resource utilization and cost savings. Web searches and authoritative blog posts, such as those from Weaviate, indicate that multi-tenancy can be implemented at various levels, including application, namespace, and cluster levels, each with its own trade-offs in terms of tenant isolation, infrastructure costs, and security. While application-level tenancy requires the application to be designed with multi-tenancy in mind, namespace and cluster-level tenancy can be applied to existing single-tenant applications to enable them to operate in a multi-tenant SaaS environment. Weaviate's upcoming v1.20 release introduces native multi-tenancy support, which promises ease of use, GDPR-compliant deletes, and scalability to millions of tenants without significant computational overhead. This new feature underscores the importance of multi-tenancy in cloud computing, particularly for SaaS solutions that need to serve a diverse and potentially large customer base efficiently. Open-source tools like OPA and OPAL, as well as services like Permit.io, offer ready-made solutions for implementing authorization layers that support multi-tenancy, simplifying the transition for applications and ensuring secure and compliant access separation.\nThe concept of multi-tenancy, which refers to a software architecture where a single instance of software serves multiple customers or \"tenants,\" is analogous to the broader idea of a conclusion in various contexts. A conclusion, as gleaned from web searches, represents the final part of something, the termination of an event, or the end result of a process. It is the culmination of preceding elements, whether in a game, a legal case, or a narrative. Similarly, blog posts from Weaviate highlight the importance of conclusions in their discussions, whether it's expressing pride in the company's achievements, summarizing the concept of Generative Feedback Loops, recapping the evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, or addressing privacy concerns in the deployment of large language models. Just as a conclusion in literature or rhetoric serves to synthesize ideas and offer closure, the implementation of multi-tenancy signifies the culmination of software design that efficiently concludes with a system capable of serving multiple distinct users, each with their own secure and private environment.\n",

Since Weaviate is open-source technology that can be installed in any environment, it enables customers to keep all data locally, without having to send to a third party over the internet. **How does Weaviate compare to AWS?**\n\nWeaviate and AWS compliment each other nicely. You can use Weaviate as your vector database with Amazon Bedrock. Start building with the [`text2vec-aws` module](\/developers\/weaviate\/modules\/retriever-vectorizer-modules\/text2vec-aws) today!\n\n**What sets Weaviate apart from other vector databases?**\n\nWeaviate is an open-source vector database, built from the ground up for vector search.![Demo of Weaviate](.\/img\/weaviate-demo.gif?i=8)\n\n## What is Weaviate and why does it need an API? Weaviate is an [open-source](https:\/\/github.com\/weaviate\/weaviate) Vector Database: for understandable knowledge representation, enabling semantic search and automatic classification. Weaviate does not only store data, but also its (automatically derived) context, consisting of linguistic information and relations to other concepts. The result is a network of knowledge, or a graph of data. One core question is: How do we interact with this new type of data storage?With easy access to data streams from across their entire business, Weaviate users can now:\n\n* **Create a real-time knowledge base:**\nBuild a shared source of real-time truth for all your operational and analytical data, no matter where it lives for sophisticated model building and fine-tuning. Think business competitive analysis dashboards that are updated with latest market news updates. * **Bring real-time context at query time:**\nConvert raw data into meaningful chunks with real-time enrichment and continually update your embedding databases for your GenAI use cases. Think real-time filtering based on region, demographics, personas in online shopping, etc. * **Build governed, secured, and trusted AI:**\nEstablish data lineage, quality and traceability, providing all your teams with a clear understanding of data origin, movement, transformations and usage.The past for vector searching definitely was not a \u201csimpler time\u201d, and the appeal of modern vector databases like Weaviate is pretty clear given this context. But while the future is here, it isn't yet perfect. Tools like Weaviate can seem like a magician's mystery box. Our users in turn ask us *exactly* how Weaviate does its magic; how it turns all of that data into vectors, and how to control the process. So let's take a look inside the magic box together in this post.One of the most important upsides of this approach was that we could use GraphQL (the graph query language which was entering the software stage through Facebook open-sourcing it) to represent the data inside Weaviate. With the concept of realtime vectorization of data objects and RDF-like representation of Weaviate objects in GraphQL, all the ingredients to turn Weaviate into the search graph that it currently is, were present. ## The Birth of the Weaviate Search Graph\nBy the end of 2018, I entered Weaviate into a startup accelerator program in The Netherlands. A place where I had the time to build a team around Weaviate that could help get the software to production and create a business model around the open-source project (the startup became: SeMI Technologies, which is short for Semantic Machine Insights). When the team started, Weaviate was more of a traditional graph where the semantic (NLP) element was a feature rather than the core architecture.Before we dive deeper into how Weaviate removes the limitations you might expect from existing ANN solutions, let's quickly take a look at what Weaviate is. Weaviate is a cloud-native, modular, real-time vector database built to scale your machine learning models. Oh, it's also open-source, by the way. Because of its modularity, Weaviate can cover a wide variety of bases. By default, Weaviate is agnostic of how you came up with your vectors.The company preferred an open source platform, and since they would be indexing millions of products, they needed a solution that was both high-performing and cost-efficient at scale. ## Selecting Weaviate as the vector database of choice \nAfter a thorough evaluation of a handful of open and closed-source vector databases, the team decided that Weaviate was the best-fit solution for their needs. They cited the following reasons for choosing Weaviate:  \n\n* Open source, with an active community and managed cloud offering. * Comprehensive documentation and strong support for popular LLMs and multi-modal models. * Direct integration of machine learning models using a module system, with the ability to easily swap out and experiment with different models.Weaviate was built to combine the speed and capabilities of ANN algorithms with the features of a database such as backups, real-time queries, persistence, and replication (part of the v1.17 release). Weaviate can be accessed through GraphQL, REST, and client libraries in multiple programming languages. ### Example Use Cases\n\nVector databases are great to use for your application if your data is constantly changing. You can use vector search engines for e-commerce recommendations, image search, semantic similarity, and the list goes on. Weaviate just released a new module that introduces a way to represent a user's interests by drawing a graph of cross-references.",

Inflexibility in data residency can clash with strict national privacy laws, making it difficult for companies to comply with regulations. Security risks are amplified in a multi-tenant environment, where a single breach could expose the data of numerous tenants. The limitations in features and data handling capabilities can render multi-tenant platforms less powerful compared to dedicated solutions, and the costs associated with transitioning to such platforms may be daunting for smaller businesses. Despite advancements like Weaviate's native multi-tenancy support, which aims to improve scalability and compliance, the disadvantages of multi-tenancy remain a concern for enterprises requiring robust, secure, and flexible cloud services.\nTopic: Types of Multi-Tenant Architecture\n\nOriginal Question: What is multi-tenancy?\n\nWeb Contexts: Multi-tenancy is a software architecture where multiple instances of an application run on the same physical server, serving multiple tenants simultaneously. This architecture allows companies to allocate a single infrastructure to several end users, optimizing maintenance and updates. There are three main types of multi-tenant databases: shared database with shared schema, where multiple schemas for the same database are shared; URL-based SaaS, where different domain names expose web services to different customers; and multi-tenant SaaS, where customers share the same software and hardware. Multi-tenancy is crucial in cloud computing, enabling providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to offer shared-tenancy options on the public cloud. It is also used in private cloud computing, where different teams within the same organization share infrastructure.\n\nBlog Contexts: Weaviate's approach to multi-tenancy allows users to select multi-tenancy for their classes, maintaining features like fast queries and cross-references while specifying a tenant key for operations. This approach addresses the need for speed, easy onboarding and offboarding, and resource boundaries without affecting other tenants. Weaviate's native multi-tenancy support is designed to scale with businesses and their customers, offering cost-efficiency and the ability to handle tenants of different sizes.\n\nParagraph: Multi-tenancy, a fundamental concept in cloud computing, refers to a software architecture where a single instance of an application serves multiple tenants, or customers, using shared resources such as databases, hardware, and software. This architecture is essential for cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, as it allows them to offer cost-effective, scalable services to a diverse range of clients. The types of multi-tenant architecture include shared database with shared schema, URL-based SaaS, and multi-tenant SaaS, each with its own method of resource sharing and data isolation. Weaviate's implementation of multi-tenancy exemplifies the modern approach to this architecture, focusing on ease of use, scalability, and efficient resource management, ensuring that the needs of both large and small tenants are met without compromising on speed or functionality. This aligns with the original question about multi-tenancy by illustrating how multiple users or applications can securely and efficiently share the same infrastructure, which is a cornerstone of cloud computing's practicality and success.\nThe concept of multi-tenancy versus single-tenancy in cloud computing and SaaS platforms is a critical decision point for businesses and software developers, as it impacts cost, security, scalability, and customization. The original question, \"What is multi-tenancy?\" leads us to explore the differences between these two architectural models. Multi-tenancy refers to a single software instance and infrastructure serving multiple customers or tenants, with each tenant's data isolated but operating within a shared system. This model is akin to residents living in separate apartments within the same building, sharing common facilities but maintaining private spaces. It offers cost savings, efficient resource usage, and easy scalability due to economies of scale, but it can pose greater security risks and complicate cost visibility per customer. Single-tenancy, on the other hand, provides each customer with a dedicated instance of the software and infrastructure, resembling a single-family home with its own amenities and security system. This model offers greater customization, security, and control, but at a higher cost and potential underutilization of resources. A mixed tenancy model attempts to balance these approaches by providing some dedicated and some shared components. Authoritative blog posts from Weaviate highlight the ease of implementing multi-tenancy in their platform, where specifying a tenant key in the schema is the primary change required to maintain efficient operations across numerous tenants. This approach addresses the need for cost-efficiency, diversity of tenant sizes, and resource boundaries without compromising on speed or ease of onboarding and offboarding tenants. Ultimately, the choice between multi-tenancy and single-tenancy depends on the specific needs of a business, including considerations around privacy, security, scalability, and cost.\nTopic: Multi-Tenancy Use Cases\n\nOriginal Question: What is multi-tenancy?\n\nWeb Contexts: Multi-tenancy is an architecture that allows a single instance of software to serve multiple tenants, where tenants are different user groups or customers. It is a common approach in cloud services, enabling efficient resource usage and cost savings. GRNET, for example, uses a project-based approach for resource allocation in a multi-tenancy environment, aiming to enhance data isolation and explore encryption solutions for stronger security. Multi-tenancy is often contrasted with single-tenancy, where each tenant has a dedicated set of resources, allowing for greater customization but at a higher cost and with a larger infrastructural footprint.\n\nBlog Contexts: Weaviate's v1.20 release introduces native multi-tenancy support, simplifying the management of multiple tenants by allowing users to specify a tenant key for operations.

This architecture is particularly beneficial for diverse tenant sizes and is exemplified by applications such as Salesforce and WordPress, which serve a multitude of clients on a single platform.\nTopic: Disadvantages of Multi-Tenancy\n\nOriginal Question: What is multi-tenancy?\n\nWeb Contexts: Multi-tenancy is a common architecture for cloud services where a single instance of software serves multiple customers or tenants. While it offers cost savings and scalability, it also has several disadvantages. These include inflexibility, as customers cannot always dictate where their data is stored, which can be a problem for businesses with strict data residency requirements. Security is another concern; a breach in a multi-tenant environment could potentially compromise the data of multiple customers. Additionally, multi-tenant platforms may lack the power and features of dedicated solutions, with limitations on data storage and support for standard programming languages. The cost of migrating to a multi-tenant platform can also be prohibitive for smaller companies.\n\nBlog Contexts: The blog from Weaviate highlights the evolution of multi-tenancy support and the challenges faced before the introduction of native multi-tenancy support in Weaviate `v1.20`. It discusses the difficulties in scaling and managing a large number of tenants, as well as the need for compliance and smooth user experience. The new release aims to address these issues by providing GDPR-compliant deletes and the ability to handle millions of tenants efficiently.\n\nParagraph: The concept of multi-tenancy, while beneficial for its cost-efficiency and scalability, presents several challenges that can impact businesses negatively. Inflexibility in data residency can clash with strict national privacy laws, making it difficult for companies to comply with regulations. Security risks are amplified in a multi-tenant environment, where a single breach could expose the data of numerous tenants. The limitations in features and data handling capabilities can render multi-tenant platforms less powerful compared to dedicated solutions, and the costs associated with transitioning to such platforms may be daunting for smaller businesses. Despite advancements like Weaviate's native multi-tenancy support, which aims to improve scalability and compliance, the disadvantages of multi-tenancy remain a concern for enterprises requiring robust, secure, and flexible cloud services.\nTopic: Types of Multi-Tenant Architecture\n\nOriginal Question: What is multi-tenancy?\n\nWeb Contexts: Multi-tenancy is a software architecture where multiple instances of an application run on the same physical server, serving multiple tenants simultaneously. This architecture allows companies to allocate a single infrastructure to several end users, optimizing maintenance and updates. There are three main types of multi-tenant databases: shared database with shared schema, where multiple schemas for the same database are shared; URL-based SaaS, where different domain names expose web services to different customers; and multi-tenant SaaS, where customers share the same software and hardware. Multi-tenancy is crucial in cloud computing, enabling providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to offer shared-tenancy options on the public cloud. It is also used in private cloud computing, where different teams within the same organization share infrastructure.\n\nBlog Contexts: Weaviate's approach to multi-tenancy allows users to select multi-tenancy for their classes, maintaining features like fast queries and cross-references while specifying a tenant key for operations. This approach addresses the need for speed, easy onboarding and offboarding, and resource boundaries without affecting other tenants. Weaviate's native multi-tenancy support is designed to scale with businesses and their customers, offering cost-efficiency and the ability to handle tenants of different sizes.\n\nParagraph: Multi-tenancy, a fundamental concept in cloud computing, refers to a software architecture where a single instance of an application serves multiple tenants, or customers, using shared resources such as databases, hardware, and software. This architecture is essential for cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, as it allows them to offer cost-effective, scalable services to a diverse range of clients. The types of multi-tenant architecture include shared database with shared schema, URL-based SaaS, and multi-tenant SaaS, each with its own method of resource sharing and data isolation. Weaviate's implementation of multi-tenancy exemplifies the modern approach to this architecture, focusing on ease of use, scalability, and efficient resource management, ensuring that the needs of both large and small tenants are met without compromising on speed or functionality. This aligns with the original question about multi-tenancy by illustrating how multiple users or applications can securely and efficiently share the same infrastructure, which is a cornerstone of cloud computing's practicality and success.\nThe concept of multi-tenancy versus single-tenancy in cloud computing and SaaS platforms is a critical decision point for businesses and software developers, as it impacts cost, security, scalability, and customization. The original question, \"What is multi-tenancy?\" leads us to explore the differences between these two architectural models. Multi-tenancy refers to a single software instance and infrastructure serving multiple customers or tenants, with each tenant's data isolated but operating within a shared system. This model is akin to residents living in separate apartments within the same building, sharing common facilities but maintaining private spaces. It offers cost savings, efficient resource usage, and easy scalability due to economies of scale, but it can pose greater security risks and complicate cost visibility per customer. Single-tenancy, on the other hand, provides each customer with a dedicated instance of the software and infrastructure, resembling a single-family home with its own amenities and security system. This model offers greater customization, security, and control, but at a higher cost and potential underutilization of resources. A mixed tenancy model attempts to balance these approaches by providing some dedicated and some shared components. Authoritative blog posts from Weaviate highlight the ease of implementing multi-tenancy in their platform, where specifying a tenant key in the schema is the primary change required to maintain efficient operations across numerous tenants. This approach addresses the need for cost-efficiency, diversity of tenant sizes, and resource boundaries without compromising on speed or ease of onboarding and offboarding tenants. Ultimately, the choice between multi-tenancy and single-tenancy depends on the specific needs of a business, including considerations around privacy, security, scalability, and cost.\nTopic: Multi-Tenancy Use Cases\n\nOriginal Question: What is multi-tenancy?\n\nWeb Contexts: Multi-tenancy is an architecture that allows a single instance of software to serve multiple tenants, where tenants are different user groups or customers. It is a common approach in cloud services, enabling efficient resource usage and cost savings. GRNET, for example, uses a project-based approach for resource allocation in a multi-tenancy environment, aiming to enhance data isolation and explore encryption solutions for stronger security. Multi-tenancy is often contrasted with single-tenancy, where each tenant has a dedicated set of resources, allowing for greater customization but at a higher cost and with a larger infrastructural footprint.\n\nBlog Contexts: Weaviate's v1.20 release introduces native multi-tenancy support, simplifying the management of multiple tenants by allowing users to specify a tenant key for operations. This feature is designed to be cost-efficient, handle a diversity of tenant sizes, and ensure ease of use with Weaviate's features. It also emphasizes compliance, such as GDPR-compliant deletes, and aims to provide a smooth user experience with minimal computational load for onboarding or offboarding tenants, as well as maintaining resource boundaries to prevent one tenant's activities from affecting another.\n\nParagraph: Multi-tenancy is a software architecture that enables a single application to serve multiple distinct user groups or customers, each considered a tenant. This approach is particularly beneficial in cloud environments, as it optimizes resource usage and reduces costs. For instance, GRNET's adoption of multi-tenancy allows for project-based resource allocation while seeking to enhance data security through encryption. Weaviate's v1.20 release further simplifies multi-tenancy by introducing native support that scales efficiently, maintains resource boundaries, and ensures compliance with regulations like GDPR. This allows for diverse tenant sizes and demands, from small to large, and facilitates easy tenant management, including onboarding and offboarding, without affecting the performance or service delivery to other tenants. Multi-tenancy, therefore, offers a future-proof platform that balances performance, cost, and maintenance, making it a preferred choice for many organizations over single-tenancy, which, while offering greater customization, comes with higher costs and a larger infrastructural footprint.\nThe concept of multi-tenancy refers to a software architecture where a single instance of an application serves multiple customers or tenants. The original question, \"What is multi-tenancy?\" highlights the need to understand how this approach allows for efficient resource utilization and cost savings. Web searches and authoritative blog posts, such as those from Weaviate, indicate that multi-tenancy can be implemented at various levels, including application, namespace, and cluster levels, each with its own trade-offs in terms of tenant isolation, infrastructure costs, and security. While application-level tenancy requires the application to be designed with multi-tenancy in mind, namespace and cluster-level tenancy can be applied to existing single-tenant applications to enable them to operate in a multi-tenant SaaS environment. Weaviate's upcoming v1.20 release introduces native multi-tenancy support, which promises ease of use, GDPR-compliant deletes, and scalability to millions of tenants without significant computational overhead. This new feature underscores the importance of multi-tenancy in cloud computing, particularly for SaaS solutions that need to serve a diverse and potentially large customer base efficiently. Open-source tools like OPA and OPAL, as well as services like Permit.io, offer ready-made solutions for implementing authorization layers that support multi-tenancy, simplifying the transition for applications and ensuring secure and compliant access separation.\nThe concept of multi-tenancy, which refers to a software architecture where a single instance of software serves multiple customers or \"tenants,\" is analogous to the broader idea of a conclusion in various contexts. A conclusion, as gleaned from web searches, represents the final part of something, the termination of an event, or the end result of a process. It is the culmination of preceding elements, whether in a game, a legal case, or a narrative. Similarly, blog posts from Weaviate highlight the importance of conclusions in their discussions, whether it's expressing pride in the company's achievements, summarizing the concept of Generative Feedback Loops, recapping the evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, or addressing privacy concerns in the deployment of large language models. Just as a conclusion in literature or rhetoric serves to synthesize ideas and offer closure, the implementation of multi-tenancy signifies the culmination of software design that efficiently concludes with a system capable of serving multiple distinct users, each with their own secure and private environment.\n",
